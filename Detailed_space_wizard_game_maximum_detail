Welcoem to the Settlers of Mars - Space Wizard addition

# Settlers of Mars 
Goal: This is a role-playing game where you develop and learn about your own personal character. 
As you adventure across the board, a series of developments occur on your journey through the Settlers of Mars board game. 
Your personal character and team embark on a quest to Mars, during which you will encounter a series of environments that may contain challenges or rewards. 
How will your team use these to further your journey through time and the space made available by earlier settlers on Mars?
The choices you make determine how far we go.

## To Start the game first give each player a role and a dice to roll if needed…

>Player 1: the “Dungeon master”/“Space wizard” uses a LLM to generate a challenge for the party to overcome (use You.com or other AI chatbots to assist with narrative synthesis, to > assist with narrative development, or "dice rolling"). 
>
>Player 2: "Graphic designer" uses AI art generators to make an image that represents each turn (adobefirefly, DALLE2, etc...).
>
>Player 3: "Medical team lead" uses LLM to write a summary of how they could overcome the challenge (BARD).
>
>Player 4: "Coder" uses LLM to generate some computer code that could help at that stage of the narrative (eg. perplexity.ai).
>
>Playrt 5: "Librarian" uses LLM to mine literature (eg. elicit.ai) 
>
>Player 6: "Military team lead" The team leader then collates these into a ‘ game turn ‘ summary slide on a white board.

Perhaps you have a mechanical engineer who wants to make some 3D models .stl, then go for it!
perhaps a musician wants to use AI to make new audio samples.
Perhaps you an electrical engineer who wants to design some circuits? Then go for it!

How many challenges / stages will your team over come you on your way to settling Mars?
That depends on you and the choices your team make,

> 3. Evolving Gameplay: The game is played in a series of sessions, each of which represents a day in the life of the colonists and the corporations they represent. The players will make decisions about how to spend their time, such as exploring the planet, building new structures, or conducting scientific research. They will also have to deal with unexpected challenges, such as natural disasters, hostile aliens, or even the occasional mutiny.

> 4. Unknown Conclusion: The game ends when the colonists have successfully established a permanent settlement on the moon and Mars. The players will then have to decide what kind of society they want to build on these two worlds. Will they be a peaceful utopia or a militaristic dictatorship? The choice is up to you!

## The star of the game is our Sun and the start of your adventure is our beautiful blue origin, Earth. 
Here are some additional details that could be included in the game if the “Dungeon Master”/“Space Wizard” chooses:

The players must choose to play as members of different factions, such as the government, a private corporation, a national military or a religious group(s)...etc... 

The game could include different types of challenges, such as political intrigue, economic hardship, and environmental disaster(s).
The game can have a variety of different endings, depending on the choices that the players make, such as…

> stopping at the moon, 
> 
> a one way trip Mars,
> 
> a return trip to Mars, 
> 
> disease outbreak on mars,
> 
> a trip to the edge of the solar system, 
> 
> meeting aliens, 
> 
> or contracting alien disease. 

This is just a basic outline, of course, the game structure will vary based on how you decide to use the dice and AI. During the game the “Dungeon Master"/"Space Wizard" will consult with BARD, ChatGTP, YOU, and make up general excuses to use the dice.

# The stages / challenges to overcome as a team: 2xD6 are rolled at each stage to help determine the narrative. Each player takes it in turn.
>
> Resource gathering on Earth: The colonists built a road across a “Catan” style Earth collecting resources needed to build a space vehicle.
>
> Launch: The colonists would launch from Earth in a specially designed spacecraft. The launch would be a critical moment, as any problems could be catastrophic.
>
> Travel to the Moon: The journey to the Moon would take about three days. The colonists would spend their time in cryosleep to conserve resources.
>
> Landing on the Moon: The colonists would land on the Moon and begin their exploration. They would conduct scientific experiments, collect samples, and set up a base camp.
>
> Travel to Mars: The journey to Mars would take about nine months. The colonists would spend their time in cryosleep to conserve resources.
>
> Landing on Mars: The colonists would land on Mars and begin their exploration. They would conduct scientific experiments, collect samples, and set up a base camp.
>
> Living on Mars: The team need to build a water mine and start farming.
>
> Travel back to Earth: The journey back to Earth would take about nine months. The colonists would spend their time in cryosleep to conserve resources.
>
> Landing on Earth: The colonists would land on Earth and be greeted as heroes. They would share their stories and knowledge with the world, and help to usher in a new era of space exploration.

The specific details of the game would depend on the interests of the players, the decisions they make, the creativity of the game designer and the role of the dice.

## Table of  statistical strengths
Table: Make a table of numerical values (1-10) that could be related to the characters' stereotypes and their skills/strengths. 
These can be used to weight dice rolls throughout the game.
The total sum of each character's characteristics score is 35. 
This ensures that each character is well-rounded and has a variety of skills that will be useful in the colonization effort.
Of course, these are just general guidelines. 

The specific characteristics and numerical values that are important for each character will depend on the specific role that they play in the colonization effort, the boosts provided by the player and the random bonus values provided by rolling the dice. 
Game players can adjust these values but they need to justify how or why -> their narrative has to convince their fellow game players.

# Games components - use the settlers of Mars board for narrative development 
## Settlers-of-mars-3D-models-
3D models for settlers of Mars board game are included in the repo' and can be printed to help as a physical guide for this educational adventure. If you're familir with the unity game platform (https://unity.com/download) and have a windowOS then you could also try launching this virtual Catan game (https://github.com/Andorr/SettlersOfCatlan).

> Settlements: Settlements could represent the different colonies that are being established on Mars. They would need to be built in strategic locations, such as near resources or transportation routes.

> Domed Cities: Cities could represent the larger, more developed colonies on Mars. They would need to be built on top of settlements and would provide more resources and benefits to the colonists.
>
> Roads: Roads could represent the transportation systems that are being built on Mars. They would need to be built between settlements and cities in order to connect them and allow the colonists to move around more easily.
>
> Development cards: Development cards could represent the different technologies that are being developed on Mars. They could be used to improve the colonists' lives, such as by providing them with food, water, or shelter.
>
> Random Robber: The random robber represent the dangers that the colonists face on Mars, such as natural disasters, radiation waves or even hostile aliens. It could be used to steal resources from the colonists or to block their access to certain areas.

2 dice: The dice could be used to determine the number of resources that are available to the colonists each turn. They could also be used to determine the outcome of events, such as natural disasters.

# Extra components colonizers can select for this Settlers of Mars role-play game:

> Spaceships: Spaceships could be used to transport the colonists to Mars and to bring them back to Earth or it’s moon. 
>
> Rovers: They could also be used to explore the Martian surface and to transport resources between different colonies.
>
> Robots: Robots could be used to help the colonists with tasks, such as building structures or mining resources. They could also be used to defend the colonies from attack.
>
> Alien defence system: Aliens could represent the other life forms that exist on Mars. They could be friendly or hostile, and they could pose a threat to the colonists.

---
## The Dungeon master / Space Wizard: Here are some potential challenges that the team might face:

> Technical problems: The spacecraft could malfunction, or the colonists could be exposed to radiation.
>
> Environmental hazards: The Moon and Mars are both harsh environments, and the colonists could be exposed to extreme temperatures, radiation, and dust.
>
> Alien life: The colonists could encounter hostile alien life forms.
>
> Psychological challenges: The long journey to Mars and back could take a toll on the colonists' mental health.

> Resource hexes: The resource hexes could be replaced with different types of Martian terrain, such as ice caps, deserts, and forests. Each type of terrain would produce different resources. For example, ice caps could produce water, deserts could produce metals, and forests could produce wood.

> Development cards: The development cards could be replaced with different types of Martian technologies, such as terraforming machines, greenhouses, and water purification systems. These technologies would give players different advantages, such as the ability to produce more resources, build more structures, or defend themselves from the harsh Martian environment.

> Robber: The robber could be replaced with a Martian dust storm. When the dust storm hits, it blocks all resource production from the hexes that it passes over.

> Victory points: Victory points could be earned by building settlements, cities, roads, and development cards. Players could also earn victory points by terraforming Mars, such as by planting trees, building canals, or creating new sources of water.
