Hello World! 

I hope you try to play Settlers of Mars with your friends, family, collagues and anyone else you get to hang out with. This is a "choose your own adventure game" that can be endulged purply in the imagination using dungeones and dragon role play, or via a 2D or 3D board game based on the Settlers and Civilisation classics.

The making of the modeles is option but does assist with creating the adventure and provides a fun project based learning program for introductory adative manufacturing.

The martian and lunar surface designs can be found in the "STL files folder".

To get started playing Settler of Mars One can read any of the 3 games play templates. 
In addition, these promt's can be used to train AI-GTP's to help guide you on your adventure. 
Note: It is more fun having a real characters on your team, but having a well trained AI-space wizard can help the game play and story board systhesis occur.  

More information is coming....
