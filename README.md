# Hello World!  

I hope you try to play Settlers of Mars with your friends, family, colleagues and anyone else you get to hang out with. This is a "choose your own adventure game" that can be indulged purply in the imagination using dungeons and dragon role play, or via a 2D or 3D board game based on the Settlers and Civilisation classics. Below is a poster made by the original "Insight Wisconsin" inventors club team that made the prototype game we affectionately call "Settlers of Mars".

## The Martian and Lunar surface designs can be found in the "STL files folder".

The making of the models is an option but does assist with creating the adventure and provides a fun project-based learning program for introductory additive manufacturing.

### How to play with an AI "DnD" chatbot guide
To get started playing "Settler of Mars" players can use any of the 3 games play templates designed to tailor chatbots to facilitate an original game plan. 
These promt's can be used to train AI-GTP's to help guide you on your adventure, they can be customized to create a range of training scenarios. 

For example, feeding the chat but this report on the fututre of European Space Exploration can create a ESA related spin on the game narrative.

More information on how to hide scientific discoveries in the gameplay is coming soon(ish)... 

**Note:** 
It is more fun having a real character on your team, but having a well-trained AI-space wizard can help the gameplay and storyboard synthesis occur in a fun and informative fashion.
