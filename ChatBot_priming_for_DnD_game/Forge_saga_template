Writing Style
What writing style do you want the narrator of this world to use? By default, the narrator will use a generic short story style.

Lore Summary
What makes this world unique? This paragraph will be included in every message for the narrator's context.

Currency
This is how currency will be referred to in this world. (Gold, Credits, etc.)... Will default to "gold" if left empty.

Lorebook
Think of this like the DM notes for your world. This is where you can write down all the details about locations, people, etc. that you want to seed into your adventures for this world. This will form the searchable database for your world details. Separate single entries with double newlines for best results.
