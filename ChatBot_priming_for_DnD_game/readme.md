If you don't have any experience playing DnD, Warhammer or other probability role-play games then having a customised AI "chatbot" to help guide you and your team on a fun and educational adventure can be helpful. 

These text files provide guides that you can use to adapt chatbots to help you play "Settlers of Mars" games. Essentially copy and past it into a modern GPT chatbot and it will help it assume the role of "Dungeon Master" / "Space Wiard".

These guides can be given to chatbots such as OpenAI GPT4.0, OpenAI DALLE, OpenAI Game Time, Perplexicty.ai, Ora.ai, You.ai, nightcafe.ai to "train" AI chatbots to help you navigate the game.

If you fine-tune your own Settlers of Mars Chat bot script please feel free to share it here :-)
